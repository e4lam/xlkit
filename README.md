## XLKit - Modern C++ Wrapper for the Excel XLL SDK

XLKit is a modern C++ wrapper for using the Excel XLL SDK. It is used to write native plug-ins (aka *Add-Ins*) for Microsoft Excel. This is an open-source project distributed under the Mozilla Public License v2.0.

The requirements for this library are:
- Visual Studio 2013
- Headers from [Boost] (http://www.boost.org)
- [Excel XLL SDK] (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/bb687883%28v=office.15%29.aspx)

It was developed using the Excel 2013 XLL SDK and Boost 1.55 although older versions should work as well. The requirement for Visual Studio 2013 is because it uses C++11 features.
